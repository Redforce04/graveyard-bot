# Graveyard Bot
An open source extensive custom discord bot. Although this bot is designed for private use, anyone can work on it, or use the code.

Graveyard bot is built in C# through asp.net. This is so that graveyard bot can utilize the full range of advantages that asp.net offers, and it will make it easier to add neat webpage items later on. Graveyard bot also uses Victoria and Lavalink to provide a powerful music bot. One key advantage of using asp.net is that it is easy to make an interactive webhook for the discord api, allowing for endpoint interactions, and /commands, not possible through a standalone discord client.
